## Usage

### Cakefile

Based on Sam Stephenson's *Node-Coffee-Project* [Cakefile](https://github.com/sstephenson/node-coffee-project/blob/master/Cakefile)

- `cake build` will compile the source files from /src into JavaScript files in /lib 
- `cake watch` will recompile the source files when they are modified
- `cake docs` will generate documentation into /docs using [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco)


### Testing

We're using [Jasmine-Runner](https://github.com/jamescarr/jasmine-tool). You can run `npm test` or `jasmine mon` if you're feeling adventurous.
